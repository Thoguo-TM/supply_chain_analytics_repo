- 📊 Inventory management systems
- 📈 Sales pipelines
- 🚚 Supplier performance metrics
- 🔮 Demand forecasting models

---

## 🎯 Goals
- 🏆 **Master Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI** for supply chain decision-making
- 🧹 Learn **data wrangling, cleaning, and visualization**
- 📊 Build **portfolio-ready analytics dashboards** and predictive models
- 📝 Document every single day of progress
