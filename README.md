## ðŸ“– About  
This repository is my **70-week, self-directed Supply Chain Analytics Bootcamp**, built from scratch to simulate **real-world data challenges** faced by logistics, manufacturing, and retail companies.

Iâ€™m learning by building **real projects** â€” not toy examples â€” with datasets that simulate:
- Inventory systems  
- Sales pipelines  
- Supplier performance metrics  
- Demand forecasting  
---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Master Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI for supply chain decision-making  
- Learn data wrangling, cleaning, and visualization  
- Build portfolio-ready analytics dashboards and predictive models  
- Document every single day of progress
