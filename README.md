## ?? About  
This repository is my **70-week, self-directed Supply Chain Analytics Bootcamp**, built from scratch to simulate real-world data challenges faced by logistics, manufacturing, and retail companies.

I’m learning by **building real projects — not toy examples** — with datasets that simulate:  
- ?? Inventory management systems  
- ?? Sales pipelines  
- ?? Supplier performance metrics  
- ?? Demand forecasting models  

---

## ?? Goals  
- ?? **Master Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI** for supply chain decision-making  
- ?? Learn **data wrangling, cleaning, and visualization**  
- ?? Build **portfolio-ready analytics dashboards** and predictive models  
- ?? Document every single day of progress
