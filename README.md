## ðŸ“– About
This repository is my **70-week, self-directed Supply Chain Analytics Bootcamp**, built from scratch to simulate **real-world data challenges** faced by logistics, manufacturing, and retail companies.

Iâ€™m learning by **building real projects** â€” not toy examples â€” with datasets that simulate inventory systems, sales pipelines, supplier performance metrics, and demand forecasting.
