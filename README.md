## 📖 About
This repository is my **self-directed Supply Chain Analytics learning journey**, built to simulate real-world challenges in logistics, manufacturing, and retail.

I’m learning by **building real projects — not toy examples** — with datasets that simulate:
- 📊 Inventory management systems
- 📈 Sales pipelines
- 🚚 Supplier performance metrics
- 🔮 Demand forecasting models
