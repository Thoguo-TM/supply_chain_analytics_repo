## 📖 About
This repository is my **self-directed Supply Chain Analytics learning journey**, designed to simulate real-world challenges in logistics, manufacturing, and retail.

I’m learning by **building real projects — not toy examples** — with datasets that simulate:
- 📊 Inventory management systems
- 📈 Sales pipelines
- 🚚 Supplier performance metrics
- 🔮 Demand forecasting models

---

## 🎯 Goals
- 🏆 **Master Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI** for supply chain decision-making
- 🧹 Learn **data wrangling, cleaning, and visualization**
- 📊 Build **portfolio-ready analytics dashboards** and predictive models
- 📝 Document every single day of progress
