**Goal:** Learn SQL to query, clean, and aggregate SCM data from relational databases.

---

## Week 9: SQL Basics
**Day 57:** Install MySQL/PostgreSQL locally.  
**Day 58:** Create sales, inventory, suppliers tables.  
**Day 59:** SELECT basics — retrieve all sales.  
**Day 60:** SELECT specific columns + aliases.  
**Day 61:** WHERE filtering — filter products with low stock.  
**Day 62:** ORDER BY — sort sales by date.  
**Day 63:** Mini-project: Supplier report query.

## Week 10: Aggregation
**Day 64:** COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX on sales.  
**Day 65:** GROUP BY product category.  
**Day 66:** HAVING — filter groups by conditions.  
**Day 67:** Practice aggregation on returns dataset.  
**Day 68:** DISTINCT — find unique suppliers.  
**Day 69:** Aggregate monthly sales by category.  
**Day 70:** Mini-project: Monthly sales summary query.

## Week 11: Joins
**Day 71:** INNER JOIN sales & inventory.  
**Day 72:** LEFT JOIN to include products with no sales.  
**Day 73:** RIGHT JOIN — find missing inventory entries.  
**Day 74:** FULL OUTER JOIN supplier coverage.  
**Day 75:** Self-join for hierarchical supplier chains.  
**Day 76:** Join 3+ tables for full SCM view.  
**Day 77:** Mini-project: Supply chain master query.

## Week 12: Subqueries & CTEs
**Day 78:** Subquery in WHERE — find top-selling products.  
**Day 79:** Subquery in FROM — aggregate before joining.  
**Day 80:** Common Table Expressions for cleaner queries.  
**Day 81:** Multiple CTE chains.  
**Day 82:** Practice with delayed shipment dataset.  
**Day 83:** Nested subquery challenge.

## Week 13: Data Cleaning in SQL
**Day 85:** TRIM, UPPER, LOWER, REPLACE for text cleanup.  
**Day 86:** DATE functions for delivery analysis.  
**Day 87:** COALESCE & NULL handling.  
**Day 88:** Remove duplicates with DISTINCT/ROW_NUMBER.  
**Day 89:** Validate SKUs with pattern matching.  
**Day 90:** Practice cleaning messy order data.  
**Day 91:** Mini-project: Clean master data tables.

## Week 14: Phase Project
